# UnityShared
A collection of folders containing scripts I use in several projects


How to get a specific folder?

Navigate to a folder outside your Assets folder; the root folder of your unity folder is a good place.
Create a new folder, folder name suggestion: 'Extras'
On a terminal, enter >

npm init #complete the basic setup, which will create a package.json file
npm install git+https://github.com/chadiik/UnityShared.git
